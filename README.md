# Microbial-Biogeography-in-Southeastern-Tibet
To investigate the soil microbial diversity in Hengduan Mountain area (the southeastern Tibet Plateau ), we sampled 12 sites along a typical elevation gradient with the total of 132 samples. This project included workflow codes to replicate our analysis and findings.
