# Microbial-Biogeography-in-Southeastern-Tibet
To investigate the soil microbial diversity in Hengduan Mountain area (the southeastern Tibet Plateau ), we sampled 12 sites along a typical elevation gradient with the total of 132 samples. This project included workflow codes to replicate our analysis and findings.

Before to run all codes, please check package installations in your PC or servers by *0_function.R*. We suggest to replicate our work in R > 4.0

We prepared output of calculating stochastic processes because related scripts are very time-consuming.

If you want to re-process all raw data, you can access Illumina sequencing data deposited in GenBank Short Read Archive (SRA) with BioProject number PRJNA980427 (bacterial communities) and PRJNA980438 (fungal communities). These raw data will released once upon publication. However, we still suggest you to use  ASV tables and OTU tables generated by us.

If you have any problem, please feel free to contact me.
